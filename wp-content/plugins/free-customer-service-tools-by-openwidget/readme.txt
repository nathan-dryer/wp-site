= AI features for your WordPress website =

At OpenWidget, we bring you a variety of AI features available out of the box – you don't need to host anything at your side or take care of maintaining AI models. Add OpenWidget to your website and start using:

- **ChatGPT for WordPress**

Our free Chat Interface for OpenAI Assistants allows you to create your very own OpenAI Assistant and link it with a free chat box that you can add to your WordPress - no coding skills required. With its help, you can **provide your customers with 24/7 automated Customer Support** by offering a true ChatGPT experience on your website. 

What's more, you can train your assistant with various materials that you already have, like your FAQ or other articles about your products or services. We also have a dedicated YouTube video that will tell you not only how to add ChatGPT to your website, but also how to create your own OpenAI Assistant as well!

Also, feel free to check out our dedicated **[How to create your OpenAI Assistant and install it on any website](https://openwidget.com/blog/how-to-create-your-openai-assistant)** blog post.

- **AI-based Product Recommendations Widget**

Our Product Recommendations Widget operates on a simple yet powerful principle. As customers browse through your website, our advanced algorithm, combined with a model powered by OpenAI, analyzes their browsing patterns and cross-references them with your online goods. 

This process enables us to identify products that align perfectly with your customers' interests and needs. Once they are ready, recommendations are presented to your customers in the captivating form of a card, displaying the products right at their fingertips.

- **AI-enhanced OpenWidget configuration**

When setting up your OpenWidget account, you can use our AI-enhanced product configuration features to customize the following features:

- **Welcome message in our Contact Card**
- **Products description in our Product Cards**
- **FAQ module**

**Welcome Messages** feature leverages the advanced language capabilities of OpenAI to create a personalized and engaging greeting for your customers. All you need to do is to provide a few keywords describing what the welcome message should be about. With just a click of a button, **our app will dynamically generate a unique message tailored to your specific context,** whether it is the time of day, your store's location, or information when you are available to answer your customers' questions.

The same goes for our **Product Descriptions** feature that you can now enhance with the power of OpenAI. **Instead of typing the whole text by hand,** you can now give us a few phrases describing your product best, and we will do the rest for you. Or you can copy the description you have on hand and check if we can come up with something better.

But that's not all! With our **AI-enhanced FAQ,** we are removing the struggle of typing the answers to the most frequent questions by hand. All you need to do is to provide us with common customer questions, a few keywords related to those, and **we will generate the complete answers for you.**

= Automated onboarding =

At OpenWidget, we believe the product should tailor itself to you and your brand, and it should do it automatically. To achieve that, we offer you an automated onboarding that will:

- grab your website's screenshot so that you can, in real-time, **check how the widget will look on your page;**
- suggest a language and a tailored theme for your widget so that it matches your brand.

And all of that with just a click of a button.

= Ready-made integrations with other text| products =

- **LiveChat integration**

LiveChat is the best live chat software that you can use to **build your Customer Support and connect with your customers.** It is not only a real-time chatting tool for customers on your website, but also a place where you can **create a communication hub capable of gathering messages from multiple channels.** Channels like Apple Messages for Business, Messenger from Meta, WhatsApp Business, Email, SMS.

What's more, with our other AI-based product ChatBot available out of the box, you will make sure that your Customer Service will not only be **available 24/7,** but it'll also **automatically learn about your business** from the content of your website and answer any questions your customers may have. And now you can integrate it seamlessly with OpenWidget. **Try it out for free, with a 14-day trial period!**

OpenWidget's Contact, Feedback, and Bug Report Forms are a great and free way to engage with your customers. You can use them to not only **build meaningful relations** with your visitors but also listen to their feedback and **improve your products and services.**

With our official HelpDesk integration, we want to help you manage all of the messages left by your customers via OpenWidget.
